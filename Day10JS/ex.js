let nam = "John";
let topic = "JavaScript";

console.log(nam + " is learning " + topic + " today");

// you can also use the template strings format, which allows you to embed a variable directly inside the string as follows:
// console.log(`${nam} is learning ${topic} today`);


// let score = "10" + "30";

// console.log(score);



// let score2 = 10 + '30';

// console.log(score2);




// let score3 = 10 + 30;

// console.log(score3);


// let f = 1.2;
// let z = 2.35;

// console.log(f + z);


// let first_name;

// console.log(first_name);


// You can also assign undefined to a variable explicitly as follows:

// let last_name = undefined;


//objects in js
// // Creating an empty object
// let person = {};

// // Adding properties to the object
// person.firstName = "John";
// person.lastName = "Doe";
// person.age = 30;

// // You can also create an object with properties in a single step
// let car = {
//   make: "Toyota",
//   model: "Camry",
//   year: 2020
// };

// // Accessing object properties
// console.log(person.firstName); // "John"
// console.log(car.model);       // "Camry"



// Null in JavaScript
// The null value is a special data type that represents an empty or unknown value. Here's how you assign a variable as null:

// let first_name = null;
// The code above means that the value of first_name is empty or unknown.
// Both undefined and null are values that represent nothing, and other programming languages usually only have one, and that is null.

// In JavaScript, the undefined value is reserved as the default value when a variable is declared, while null means you intentionally assign an "empty" value for the variable.



// A function doesn't need any object and is independent, while the method is a function, which is linked with any object. We can directly call the function with its name, while the method is called by the object's name. Function is used to pass or return the data, while the method operates the data in a class.
